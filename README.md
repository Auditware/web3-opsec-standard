## Overview

The Web3 Operational Security Standard (W3OS) is an open standard that defines comprehensive security requirements for organizations operating in Web3. W3OS provides a framework for:
- **Organizations** to measure and maximize their operational security posture against traditional and Web3-specific risks
- **Auditors** to consistently and comprehensively evaluate organizational OpSec posture and easily manage review efforts
- **Stakeholders** to evaluate the security maturity of their organizations and reduce risk

## How to Use W3OS

Use the interactive page to track your progress through W3OS and measure your organization's level of compliance: https://w3osc.github.io/web3-opsec-standard/index.html

## Why W3OS?

Web3 organizations face unique operational security challenges that traditional Web2 security frameworks don't adequately address:

- **Digital Asset Management**: Securing cryptocurrency wallets, multi-signature schemes, and on-chain operations
- **Community-Driven Operations**: Securing social channels, governance processes, and public communications
- **Rapid Development Cycles**: Balancing security with the fast-paced nature of Web3 development

Other Web3 security standards exist, but are not specifically focused on OpSec. W3OS is designed to be straightforward, actionable, and dedicated to operational security to supplement traditional code audits and help Web3 organizations maximize their overall security posture.
