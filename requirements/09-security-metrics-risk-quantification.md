### **Security Metrics Framework**

**SP-SM-001: Security Performance Tracking**
- Set up security metrics that align with your business goals
- Track metrics for prevention, detection, and response capabilities
- Automatically collect metrics when possible for accuracy and timeliness
- Track both forward-looking metrics (prevention) and backward-looking metrics (incidents)
- Compare your metrics against industry standards and similar organizations

**SP-SM-002: Calculate Financial Risk**
- Use standard frameworks to calculate risks in dollar amounts
- Include probability, impact, and time exposure in risk calculations
- Calculate monetary risk values using asset values and potential loss estimates
- Define how much risk your organization is willing to accept
- Make risk decisions based on cost-benefit analysis

**SP-SM-003: Measure Security Maturity**
- Regularly assess your security maturity using recognized frameworks
- Score maturity across all security areas and control types
- Identify specific gaps that need investment to improve
- Create improvement roadmaps with timelines and resource needs
- Track security maturity improvements over time

### **Operational Security Metrics**

**SP-SM-004: Incident Response Performance**
- Measure how long it takes to detect security incidents (MTTD)
- Track how long it takes to respond to incidents (MTTR)
- Measure how effectively you contain and stop incidents
- Track false positive rates for all detection systems
- Measure security training effectiveness through phishing simulations

**SP-SM-005: Vulnerability Management Performance**
- Track how many vulnerabilities are found across all your systems
- Measure how quickly you patch critical vulnerabilities
- Track what percentage of your systems are covered by vulnerability scanning
- Measure vulnerability exposure from third-party vendors and services
- Assess how prepared you are for zero-day vulnerabilities

**SP-SM-006: Access Control Performance**
- Track completion rates for privileged access reviews
- Measure how quickly you fulfill access requests
- Track how effectively you manage account lifecycles
- Measure multi-factor authentication adoption rates
- Track identity and access management system uptime and performance

### **Web3-Specific Security Metrics**

**SP-SM-007: Multi-Signature Performance**
- Measure and optimize multi-sig transaction approval times
- Track signer availability and response times
- Measure transaction simulation accuracy rates
- Monitor and minimize time-lock bypass frequency
- Calculate and report multi-sig wallet security scores

**SP-SM-008: Smart Contract and DeFi Security Metrics**
- Smart contract audit coverage percentage must be tracked
- On-chain monitoring alert accuracy must be measured and tuned
- DeFi protocol interaction risk scores must be calculated
- Cross-chain transaction security metrics must be established
- Governance participation and security voting metrics must be tracked

**SP-SM-009: Cryptocurrency Asset Security Metrics**
- Asset segregation compliance rates must be measured
- Hot wallet exposure ratios must be tracked and minimized
- Cold storage access frequency must be monitored
- Asset recovery time estimates must be calculated and tested
- Cryptocurrency insurance coverage adequacy must be assessed

### **Risk Quantification and Business Alignment**

**SP-SM-010: Financial Impact Assessment**
- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) must be calculated for all major risk scenarios
- Security investment Return on Investment (ROI) must be quantified
- Cost of security incidents must be fully calculated including indirect costs
- Business disruption impact must be quantified in monetary terms
- Regulatory compliance cost avoidance must be measured and reported

**SP-SM-011: Business Continuity and Resilience Metrics**
- Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) achievement rates must be measured
- Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) compliance must be tracked
- Business continuity plan testing effectiveness must be quantified
- Disaster recovery exercise success rates must be measured
- Third-party dependency risk exposure must be calculated

### **Leadership and Communication**

**SP-SM-012: Security Reporting and Communication**
- Regular security posture reports must be provided to organizational leadership
- Key risk indicators (KRIs) must be tracked and reported to decision makers
- Trend analysis must show security posture improvements or degradations over time
- Security investment justifications must be supported by quantitative analysis
- Incident impact reporting must include operational and financial consequences
