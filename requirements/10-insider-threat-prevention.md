# Domain 10: Insider Threat Prevention & Remote Workforce Security

## Risks

- R-IT-001: Nation-State Operative Infiltration Through Hiring
- R-IT-002: Compromised Employee Device and Location Spoofing
- R-IT-003: Malicious Code Injection by Trusted Contributors
- R-IT-004: Remote Worker Identity Fraud and Impersonation
- R-IT-005: Behavioral Changes Indicating Employee Compromise
- R-IT-006: Privileged Access Abuse by Remote Employees

### **Remote Hiring and Identity Verification**

**SP-IT-001: Enhanced Identity Verification for Remote Workers**
- Require video interviews with multiple team members for all remote positions
- Verify government-issued identification documents through multiple channels
- Use background check services that verify employment, education, and criminal history
- Require references from previous employers and conduct direct verification calls
- For high-privilege roles, require in-person meetings or trusted third-party verification

**SP-IT-002: Device and Access Validation**
- Require organization-provided devices for all remote work activities
- Monitor IP addresses and VPN usage for security anomalies
- Validate time zone consistency with claimed location
- Flag unusual access patterns or location changes for security review

**SP-IT-003: Ongoing Verification**
- Conduct periodic video calls to verify remote worker identity
- Require re-verification of identity documents for high-privilege roles
- Implement buddy system pairing for high-risk remote workers
- Monitor system access patterns for unusual times or locations

### **Code and Contribution Security**

**SP-IT-004: Enhanced Code Review for Remote Contributors**
- Require multiple approvers for all code contributions from remote team members
- Implement automated scanning for unusual code patterns or hidden functionality
- Track code contribution patterns and flag anomalous changes in coding style or behavior
- Require detailed documentation and explanation for all significant code changes
- Implement gradual privilege escalation for new remote contributors

**SP-IT-005: Repository and Access Monitoring**
- Monitor all repository access and code downloads for unusual patterns
- Track which files and repositories each remote worker accesses
- Flag attempts to access systems or data outside of assigned responsibilities
- Monitor for bulk downloading or unusual data access patterns
- Implement time-based access controls that match expected work schedules

### **Access Monitoring and Controls**

**SP-IT-006: Access and Activity Monitoring**
- Monitor system access patterns for unusual times or unauthorized areas
- Track privileged actions and flag usage outside normal job responsibilities
- Monitor for data exfiltration attempts or bulk file downloads
- Implement automatic alerts for high-risk access attempts
- Use access analytics to identify concerning patterns

### **Access Control and Segregation**

**SP-IT-007: Remote Worker Access Segregation**
- Implement network segmentation that isolates remote worker access
- Use just-in-time access provisioning for privileged operations
- Require additional authentication for sensitive systems and data access
- Implement time-locked access that expires automatically outside work hours
- Create separate environments for remote workers vs. on-site employees

**SP-IT-008: Critical System Protection**
- Restrict remote worker access to production systems and sensitive infrastructure
- Require on-site presence or additional verification for critical system access
- Implement four-eyes principle for all production changes involving remote workers
- Use break-glass accounts that require management approval for emergency access
- Maintain separate administrative accounts with restricted remote access
