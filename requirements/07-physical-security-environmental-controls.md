## Risks

- R-PS-001: Unauthorized Physical Access to Critical Systems
- R-PS-002: Visual Surveillance and Shoulder Surfing Attacks
- R-PS-003: Environmental Disasters Affecting Operations
- R-PS-004: Theft or Tampering of Critical Hardware
- R-PS-005: Insecure Workspace Configuration
- R-PS-006: Supply Chain Tampering During Transit

### **Workspace Security**

**SP-PS-001: Secure Workspace Requirements**
- Dedicated workspace areas must be established for handling sensitive operations
- Workspaces must be positioned to prevent unauthorized visual access to screens and activities
- Clear desk policies must be enforced with all sensitive materials secured when unattended
- Workspace access must be restricted to authorized personnel only
- Physical barriers (walls, partitions, privacy screens) must prevent unauthorized observation

**SP-PS-002: Remote Work Physical Security**
- Home offices must be configured with appropriate physical security controls
- Work areas must be isolated from common areas where visitors or family members have access
- Secure storage must be provided for organizational devices and materials when not in use
- Privacy screens must be used on all devices to prevent visual eavesdropping
- Video conferencing backgrounds and camera positioning must prevent disclosure of sensitive information

**SP-PS-003: Clean Workspace Policies**
- All physical documents containing sensitive information must be secured or destroyed after use
- Computer screens must be locked or positioned away from public view when unattended
- Whiteboards and physical planning materials must be cleared of sensitive information
- Disposal of sensitive materials must follow secure destruction procedures
- Physical access tokens (hardware keys, badges) must be secured when not in use

### **Device and Hardware Security**

**SP-PS-004: Device Physical Security**
- Critical devices must be physically secured using locks, cables, or enclosures when unattended
- Hardware wallets must be stored in fireproof safes or secure storage when not in use
- Device storage and transport must follow secure procedures with documented chain of custody
- End-of-life hardware disposal must include secure data destruction verification

### **Environmental and Disaster Protection**

**SP-PS-005: Home Office Environmental Security**
- Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems should be used for critical work devices
- Backup internet connectivity (cellular hotspot, secondary ISP) must be available
- Fire and water damage protection must be implemented for hardware storage areas
- Climate control must protect sensitive equipment from temperature and humidity extremes

**SP-PS-006: Business Continuity Planning**
- Alternative work locations must be identified and prepared for emergency use
- Critical data must be backed up to geographically distributed locations
- Communication systems must remain functional during local disasters
- Emergency procedures must be documented and accessible to all team members

### **Supply Chain Security**

**SP-PS-007: Hardware Procurement Security**
- Hardware must be obtained directly from manufacturers or authorized distributors
- Devices must be inspected for tampering upon receipt before deployment
- Hardware wallets must be purchased using pseudonyms and delivered to secure locations
- Chain of custody documentation should be maintained for critical hardware

## Physical Security Implementation Checklist

### **Workspace Security**

- [ ] Secure storage (fireproof safe, locked filing cabinet) for hardware wallets and sensitive materials
- [ ] Workspace positioned away from windows or public view
- [ ] Background materials removed from video conferencing areas
- [ ] WiFi network secured with WPA3 encryption and strong passwords
- [ ] Physical locks on doors to workspace areas when possible

**Clean Workspace Practices**
- [ ] Clear desk policy implemented and enforced
- [ ] Screen locks activated automatically after short idle periods
- [ ] Physical documents secured or destroyed after use
- [ ] Whiteboards and planning materials cleared of sensitive information
- [ ] Physical access tokens (hardware keys) secured when not in use

### **Device and Hardware Protection**

**Physical Device Security**
- [ ] Critical devices secured with physical locks or cables when unattended
- [ ] Hardware wallets stored in fireproof safes when not in use
