## Overview


---
#### Authentic Hardware Procurement
- [ ] Hardware wallets should be obtained through verified supply chains (direct from manufacturer is ideal)
- [ ] Device authenticity must be cryptographically verifiable upon receipt
#### Hardware Wallet Features
 - [ ] Hardware wallets must support large screens capable of displaying complete transaction data
 - [ ] Clear signing technology is recommended
 - [ ] Devices must have secure PIN entry with randomized entry layouts
 - [ ] PIN entry must have time-based lockouts to prevent brute force attacks
 - [ ] Hardware wallets must support firmware integrity verification
#### Mnemonic Seed Phrase Protection
 - [ ] Seed phrases must be stored on disaster-resistant, physical media
 - [ ] Seed phrases must not be stored in plain text - they must be encrypted with a randomly generated word order permutation, with the permutation key stored in a password manager
 - [ ] Private keys and seed phrases must be generated on wallet devices and must never be exported
 - [ ] Alternatively, seed phrases can be sharded using Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm, with each shard recommended to be shared with a trusted guardian (3rd party custodian service, family members, password manager, personal physical media, etc.)
#### Physical Security
 - [ ] Wallets must have a PIN requirement or biometric factor required to access the wallet and approve transactions
 - [ ] PINs must be at least 6 digits long
 - [ ] Wallets should be physically secured in a safe or secret hiding place when not in use
#### Dedicated Signing Machines
 - [ ] Multi-sig operations must be performed on devices dedicated only to these transactions and verification tools
 - [ ] All network access should be default blocked, with only the minimum necessary IPs to execute these transaction signatures allowed
 - [ ] Signing devices must be operated on private, authenticated networks
 - [ ] Organizations must implement active network monitoring on signing devices
#### Dedicated Devices
 - [ ] Each organization member must have a device dedicated to organization-related activities and work
 - [ ] Devices should have biometric login options, secure boot, and support for full disk encryption
 - [ ] Personal devices must never be used for work activities or have access to organization accounts
#### Device Supply Chain Security
 - [ ] Dedicated devices should be procured by the organization directly from manufacturers or authorized distributors
 - [ ] Hardware wallets should be purchased using pseudonyms and delivered to secure locations
 - [ ] Devices must be delivered securely and inspected for tampering upon receipt

 - [ ] Biometric authentication should be used to prevent password leakage to cameras and onlookers when in public
 - [ ] Privacy screens should be used when working in public spaces
 - [ ] Trusted VPNs should be used when on any public Wi-Fi
 - [ ] When traveling, an organization-managed VPN should be used to secure network traffic
 - [ ] Applications must never be run with root or administrator privileges unless absolutely necessary for specific system tasks
#### Home Network Security
 - [ ] Home WiFi networks should have recommended security settings:
	 - [ ] A strong password (at least 20 characters)
	 - [ ] Router and modem updated to the latest firmware
	 - [ ] Rotated admin login credentials (not the default for the device)
	 - [ ] Have a separate network for guest devices

#### Malware Detection
 - [ ] All organization devices should have basic antivirus software enabled (built-in OS antivirus is acceptable, but must be properly enabled without any rule exceptions)
 - [ ] Antivirus software should be regularly updated as soon as new releases are available
#### Browser Security and Isolation
  - [ ]   Organization members should implement browser app isolation
  - [ ] Suggested set up: One browser for session-based, sensitive activities; another browser for opening links and temporary browsing
  - [ ] Wallet extensions should only be used on a browser dedicated only to transacting
#### Secure External File Interaction
 - [ ] Files received from outside the organization must only be opened in a secure sandbox or after being sanitized (e.g. via [Dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks/) or Google Docs)
 - [ ] Internally shared files must be distributed via a dedicated file sharing platform (Google Drive/Docs, Dropbox, Notion, etc.), and never sent as email or DM attachments (to prevent social engineering malware delivery vectors)
 - [ ] Shared links should always be manually navigated to or re-typed (to avoid homograph attacks)
#### Browser Extension and Plugin Vetting
 - [ ] All browser extensions must be reviewed and approved before installation
 - [ ] Extensions must be obtained only from official stores (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Microsoft Edge Add-ons, etc.)
 - [ ] User-installed extensions (i.e. manually installed from file) must be prohibited on organization devices
 - [ ] Browser extension permissions must be reviewed and minimized to necessary functions only
 - [ ] Extensions with excessive permissions (read all websites, access to file system, etc.) should be avoided
#### Secure Workspace Requirements
 - [ ] Dedicated workspace areas must be established for performing sensitive operations
 - [ ] Workspaces must be positioned to prevent unauthorized visual access to screens and activities
 - [ ] Privileged operations should never be performed in public spaces
#### Remote Work Physical Security
 - [ ] Work areas must be isolated from common areas where visitors or family members have access
 - [ ] Organizational devices and materials must be securely stored when not in use
 - [ ] Privacy screens should be used on all devices to prevent visual eavesdropping when in public spaces

 - [ ] Recovery email addresses must be dedicated organizational accounts with strong security and 2FA
#### End-to-End Encrypted Channels
 - [ ] Encrypted communication should be used for confidential communications and coordination of admin operations
 - [ ] Signal or equivalent end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms can be used
#### Secure File Sharing and Viewing
 - [ ] Files received from external parties must never be directly opened, they must be sanitized with an approved software or service (e.g. [Dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks/), [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload), or [Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/141702))
 - [ ] Internally shared files must be distributed via secure file sharing platforms, never via email or chat
#### Critical Operations Confirmations
- [ ] Internal operations coordination must be confirmed in a secure channel (camera-on video calls, end-to-end encrypted chats, in person)

	- [ ] A password manager must be used (1Pass or Bitwarden recommended)
	- [ ] Password manager master passwords should be complex, and at least 20 characters with a mix of phonetic phrases, numbers, and special characters
	- [ ] [https://xkcd.com/936/](https://xkcd.com/936/)
	- [ ] Organization password manager accounts should be separate from personal password manager accounts
#### Login Methods
- [ ] SSO (Single Sign-On - e.g. Log in with Google/Github/Apple) can be used for non-sensitive accounts, but must not be enabled for highly sensitive access (financial, administrative, deployments, infrastructure, etc.)
- [ ] 2FA must be enforced on all accounts
- [ ] FIDO security keys are recommended, but mobile authenticator apps acceptable
- [ ] SMS-based 2FA must never be used unless no other option is available
