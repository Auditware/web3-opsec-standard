## Overview

Effective incident response requires comprehensive preparation before disasters strike. Attackers deliberately target organizations during vulnerable moments and aim to maximize panic and confusion. A well-structured incident response plan enables rapid damage mitigation, quick business continuity restoration, and effective containment of attacker movement while engaging in asset recovery. Remember that incident response is not just about technical controls - it requires clear procedures, designated responsibilities, and regular testing to ensure effectiveness when every second counts.

- [ ] **Recovery Procedures**:
  - [ ] Engage blockchain forensics specialists
  - [ ] Coordinate with law enforcement
  - [ ] Implement contract upgrade or redeployment procedures

### Response Planning Principles

**Prescriptive Procedures**
- [ ] **Detailed Instructions**: Create step-by-step procedures that any team member can execute
- [ ] **Clear Responsibilities**: Assign specific roles and responsibilities for each scenario
- [ ] **Decision Trees**: Provide clear decision-making frameworks for different situations
- [ ] **Contact Information**: Maintain updated emergency contact lists and escalation procedures

**Regular Testing & Updates**
- [ ] **Tabletop Exercises**: Conduct regular incident response simulations
- [ ] **Procedure Updates**: Review and update procedures based on new threats and lessons learned
- [ ] **Team Training**: Ensure all team members understand their roles in incident response

## Rapid Damage Control

ðŸ’¡ **Implement technical controls that enable immediate response to contain damage and maintain business continuity.**

### Deployment & Access Controls

**Quick Deployment Rollbacks**
- [ ] **Automated Rollback**: Implement accessible rollback mechanisms for all deployments
- [ ] **Version Control**: Maintain comprehensive version history with verified clean states
- [ ] **Rollback Testing**: Regularly test rollback procedures to ensure reliability
- [ ] **Backup Deployments**: Maintain parallel deployment environments for rapid switching

**Account Takeover (ATO) Response**
- [ ] **Rapid Access Revocation**: Implement immediate access revocation capabilities (access ripcords like password manager lockouts, SSO account freezing, and consolidated access management services)
- [ ] **Multi-Factor Reset**: Reset and re-enroll 2FA for affected accounts
- [ ] **Privilege Escalation Controls**: Immediately remove the affected accounts' permissions from all critical systems

### Data Protection & Recovery

**Non-Repudiation Controls**
- [ ] **Signed Commits**: Require signed commits for all code changes to prevent impersonation
- [ ] **Immutable Logs**: Implement tamper-proof, redundant logging systems that cannot be suppressed or edited without triggering alarms
- [ ] **Action Auditing**: Keep comprehensive audit trails for all privileged actions
- [ ] **Cryptographic Verification**: Use cryptographic signatures for critical operations where possible (e.g. using PGP keys or wallet signatures)

**Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**
- [ ] **Real-Time Monitoring**: Deploy EDR agents on all organization member devices
- [ ] **Automated Response**: Configure automated containment for detected threats (locking down the operating system, severing network and account access, etc.)
- [ ] Solutions like [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/platform/endpoint-security/), [Sentinel One](https://www.sentinelone.com/surfaces/endpoint/), or [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) (if you prefer OSS) offer deep insight into system behavior, flagging and preventing potential compromises as they occur

### Backup & Recovery Systems

**Redundant Database Backups**
- [ ] **Multiple Storage Media**: Use different storage media and locations (e.g. local and cloud storage)
- [ ] **Automated Backups**: Implement automated, verified backup procedures
- [ ] **Recovery Testing**: Regularly test backup restoration procedures
- [ ] **Encryption**: Keep backups encrypted with a secure private/public key pair (public for encryption, private kept safe and only used to decrypt backups when needed)

**Infrastructure Redundancy**
- [ ] **Multiple Availability Zones**: Deploy across multiple availability zones
- [ ] **Fallback Regions**: Maintain fallback regions for disaster recovery
- [ ] **Load Balancing**: Implement robust load balancing and failover mechanisms
- [ ] **Geographic Distribution**: Distribute critical infrastructure geographically

## Monitoring & Alerting

ðŸ’¡ **Establish comprehensive monitoring systems with immutable logging and redundant alerting to detect incidents quickly and securely.**

### Immutable Logging Systems

**Tamper-Proof Logging**
- [ ] **Write-Only Logs**: Configure logging systems to prevent modification or deletion of entries
- [ ] **Cryptographic Integrity**: Use cryptographic hashes to verify log integrity (e.g. emitted logs should have an attached HMAC when stored)
- [ ] **Real-Time Replication**: Implement real-time log replication to secure locations

**Log Monitoring & Protection**
- [ ] **Alteration Alerts**: Configure alerts for any attempts to disable or modify logs
- [ ] **Access Monitoring**: Monitor and alert on all log access attempts
- [ ] **Retention Policies**: Implement appropriate log retention policies for forensic analysis when needed

### Multi-Channel Alert Systems

**Redundant Alert Delivery**
- [ ] **Multiple Channels**: Use at least three different alert channels:
  - [ ] **Telegram Channel**: Set up a dedicated Telegram channel for security alerts
  - [ ] **Discord Bot**: Configure a Discord bot for real-time notifications in a dedicated channel
  - [ ] **Email Alerts**: Implement email alerting with multiple recipients
- [ ] **PagerDuty**: Add PagerDuty or an equivalent system for critical alerts (consider physical pagers for emergency alarms)
- [ ] **Mobile Push**: Use mobile push notifications for immediate awareness

**Alert Configuration**
- [ ] **Severity Levels**: Implement tiered alerting based on incident severity
- [ ] **Escalation Procedures**: Configure automatic escalation for unacknowledged alerts (on-call should confirm and check in, otherwise backups and managers should be paged)
- [ ] **Alert Testing**: Regularly test all alert channels to ensure reliability
