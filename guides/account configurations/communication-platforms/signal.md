## Individual Account Settings

**All organization members must configure their personal Signal accounts with the following settings:**

> **Important**: Use Signal! Chats on Signal are secured with the gold standard of end-to-end encryption and privacy features. Signal is the best place to have truly anonymous chats.
> 
> If you don't use Signal, you should at least create an account with your phone number and lock it so that you cannot be impersonated to others via SIM swap attacks.

> **Note**: You must be on the phone app to see all of these settings.
