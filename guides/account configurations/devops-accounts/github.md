## Notes

### <a id="deploy-keys-warning"></a>[1] Deploy Keys Warning
Do not use deploy keys, they are possession-based access tokens that are a significant security risk. Use [GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/overview) instead.

### <a id="enterprise-features"></a>[2] Enterprise Features
This is only available if you have a GitHub Enterprise plan. If you do not, you can set these same rules at the repo level instead.

### <a id="audit-logs"></a>[3] Audit Logs
It is recommended to regularly review audit logs for your organization at Logs > Audit log.
